                <p>
                    The supply chain starts in the development stage. In this stage, the game is
                    going through the process of being developed. This stage is where ideas are
                    discussed and put into code. All members of the team work on something during
                    this stage.

                <h2 class="rolesHeaderNames">(2) Production</h2>
                <p>
                    The next step is production. In this step, the game is advertised and promotions
                    are put on in order to gain popularity and anticipation. A few copies of the game
                    may be released during this stage, but it is mainly focused on preparing for release
                    and gaining popularity.
                    <br/>
                    This is also the stage in which the developers would find a publisher. The publisher
                    provides the developers with a platform on which to release their game.

                <h2 class="rolesHeaderNames">(3) Online Retailer</h2>
                <p>
                    In the online retailer step, the game is officially released to the public. Consumers
                    can go wherever it is that you released the game and buy their own copy. Common
                    online retailers include Steam and the Nintendo eShop.
                    <br/><br/>
                    This step is often identified as the "distribution" stage. It is in this stage of the supply
                    chain that retail stores, such as Walmart or Target, will be selling your game as physical
                    copies.

                <h2 class="rolesHeaderNames">(4) End User</h2>
                <p>
                    Finally, the last step of the supply chain is the end user stage. In this stage,
                    the game has been bought and is ready to be played by the consumer.
