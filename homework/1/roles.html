                    Most people probably don't realize or think about it, but there are
                    are numerous roles that make up a team of video game developers.
                    Common roles that are involved with developing a video game include,

                        Note: Besides for small companies where there are only a few employees, these roles
                        will generally have several people in the same position. In that case, someone will
                        be assigned the lead role, where they will micromanage their fellow role sharers.

                    A project manager is someone who is tasked with managing and leading the entire team.
                    The goal of a project manager is to ensure that the team is running smoothly and efficiently.
                    They will set goals and deadlines to meet, and make sure that the team meets the deadlines.
                    <br/><br/>
                    It's important to have someone specifically focusing on managing the team as opposed to
                    splitting that responsibility among the team members themselves. This way, it's more
                    efficient and keeps everyone else focused on their own respective tasks as well.

                    The role of the writer is usually to create the storyline of the video game.Often, video
                    games have some sort of plot that the main character follows. Some plots are simple while
                    others are very detailed. The writer does not create only the plot of the game, but also
                    the characters, setting, and even character dialogue.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Like the project manager, the responsibilities of the writer is often overlooked. Although
                    the task of developing a plot can be done by anyone else on the team, it is better to assign
                    someone who has worked extensively on their writing and story-telling skills. That makes this
                    another general task that the other team members won't have to worry about.

                    The game designer is in charge of the design of the game. This person (or people) decide/s the
                    core functions of the game, such as what should be included and how it should be interacted with. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    This is yet another general role that is usually divided by the team members. As always,
                    it is always nicer to have a separate person focusing specifically on a single task.

                    Game programmers are probably the people that pop into mind when thinking of video
                    game development. Programmers are vital as they are the ones in charge of writing
                    the code that actually makes the game function. Without a programmer, ideas will
                    only stay ideas.

                    A game artist is a person who creates the artwork for the game. This ranges anywhere
                    from characters to backgrounds and scenery. Anything seen on the screenis created
                    by a game artist (although the following role will play another part in that). Since
                    technology has come such a long way, most drawing tools that artists use nowadays are
                    digital.

                    In contrast to a game artist, an animator is the person who brings the artwork to life.
                    Whether the game is in 2D or 3D, an animator will be the one behind all the movement
                    that is seen on screen.

                    The audio engineer role is often taken for granted. Not too many people
                    notice, or appreciate, the sounds that are heard within a game. This includes any background
                    music playing, sound effects, and even dialogues.

                    Someone who manages the quality assurance task of a video game is essentially
                    the main tester of the video game development process. Their job is to test the 
                    game by playing it, looking for any bugs. It is their responsibility to assure that
                    the game is running as it should be; if not, they should report any bugs so that 
                    they may be fixed before an official release.
