                    Video games have existed since the mid 1950s. They weren't popular, though, until
                    Atari came out with the hit classic, PONG, back in November 1972. Later in 1975,
                    Atari created a way for people to play PONG from the comfort of their homes; they
                    could simply plug in the controller to their TV and play.

                    We've come a very long way since then. The great advancement of technology
                    has allowed for the video game industry to skyrocket, especially in the relatively
                    recent years. Nowadays, consoles have the ability to display holographic images,
                    as a ways to create a 3-Dimensional display.

                    Video games have also grown from mostly singleplayer to multiplayer platforms. Many of
                    the top-name video games are Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. These allow you
                    to play with other people online rather than just by yourself. This created many
                    sub-genres, per se. For example, we now have Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA).
                    It is also known as Action Real Time Strategy (ARTS) and is a subgenre of strategy games.
                    One of the most prominent examples of this category is League of Legends.

                    With the rapid growth of technology to this day, the video game industry will no doubt be
                    full of potential and opportunities. Who knows what will be accomplished in a mere 5 to 10 years?
