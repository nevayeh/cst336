                There are many different types of video games. There is a system of categorization
                based upon its production and budget level. Typically, the higher a game's ranking
                is (in terms of this categorization), it will be more developed and in a more advanced
                way, there will be more workers working on said game, and it will have been promoted
                more than games with a lower ranking.

                <p>
                    At the high-end side of the spectrum, we have AAA (read as "triple A") companies.
                    Some big AAA companies include: Nintendo, Blizzard Entertainment, and Riot Games.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Pictured on the right are the employees of Riot Games. As you can see, they have
                    the funds to hire hundreds of employees. This would not be possible if they were
                    not a company with a AAA game.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The ranking of games, from highest to lowest, is as follows:
                    <br/>
                    AAA, AA, A, B, C 
                </p>

                <h2 class="rolesHeaderNames">Indie Games</h2>
                
                <p class=roleDescription>
                    You've probably heard of "indie" games before, but it's not on the ranking of games
                    listed above. This is because most indie games are low budget and are usually not
                    well advertised.
                    <br/><br/>
                    There are, however, cases of indie games getting very popular over time. One of the
                    biggest examples includes Minecraft. It's come a far way and has grown a lot by now,
                    but don't forget that it did start with a single person, which turned into a small team,
                    which grew into the surely large team that it is today.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Another example would be Stardew Valley. It's not as popular as Minecraft, but it
                    has done considerably well. It was developed entirely by a single person over the course
                    of 4 years! He made all the artwork, sounds, etc. by himself. Even now, the developer
                    has been offered some help in developing the game, but he has chosen to remain true to
                    his origins and is still developing the game further as a lone wolf.
